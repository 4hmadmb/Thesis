# Thesis

The data sources for this thesis are the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). The GTD, managed by the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), serves as an extensive repository of information on over 200,000 terrorist incidents worldwide spanning from 1970 to 2020. It encompasses diverse forms of terrorist attacks and offers more than 50 variables to characterize each event, drawing from publicly available sources like news articles, official records, and academic publications. The database maintains rigorous standards, with a comprehensive codebook defining the criteria for each variable and confidence ratings reflecting the reliability of incident information.
